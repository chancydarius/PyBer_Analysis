# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

- The purpose of this assignment is to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. We do this to improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results: 
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Summary statistics suggest that the:
- Rural areas have a rate of ~1.6 rides per driver which says that demand for drivers is relatively high which equates to a higher average fare per driver in comparison.
- Suburban areas have a rate of ~1.27 rides per driver which says that demand for drivers is moderate.
- Urban areas have a rate of ~0.67 rides per driver which says that demand for drivers is relatively low which equates to a lower average fare per driver in comparison.

Based on the total fares by city type:
- Urban areas have the largest amount of total fares and rural the lowest amongst the city types.
- They all have a relatively linear rate of fares. i.e. all fares were in a range of ~$800.


## Summary: 
### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

- Decrease the price of rides in Rural areas to increase the demand for rides which increases the total amount of fares and then increase the supply of drivers to meet the rise in demand employing more citizens. 
- Increase the wage of the drivers in Urban areas as the demand for rides is higher and can compensate with the higher rate of fares but keep the supply of drivers.
- Decrease the price of rides in respective city types during time frames where the historical demand is lower to increase the the total amount of fares. i.e. During the first week of January in suburban areas, run a limited-time special until the third week and the demand rises again.
